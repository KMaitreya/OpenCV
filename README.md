# OpenCV

The images are taken from a folder called \images.

1)opencv-1 (Changing the colour profile of an image):
Using functions of opencv i have changed the colour profiles of an image from BGR to RGB, HSV and Grayscale. THe images are read using imread() and displayed using mathplotlib library.

2)opencv-2 (Edge detection):
In this program opencv library has been used to detect all the edges in an image, the Canny() has been used, before that the image has been converted to grayscale, for bettwe edge detection.

3)opencv-3 (Erosion and Dilation)
Erosion and dilation of edges has been performed on the cqanny image from the previous program, erode() and dilate() has been used, a ones matrix has been passed to the function which shows the degree to which erosion and dilation of an image has to take place.

4)opencv-4 (Noise reduction and removal)
Using opencv functions we have demonsrated the reduction of noise from the given image. The level of noise reduction will be based on the values passed to the function.
